# ESTIMATION-OF-FUTURE-POPULATION-STATUS-USING-GLOBAL-BIRTH-RATE-ANALYSIS-
This study aims to analyse global birth rates and their potential implications for future population status. We apply a mix of Multiple Linear Regression Time Series and Exploratory Analysis using a complete dataset that includes variables such as population, birth rate, death rate, fertility rate, population growth rate, and youth dependence ratio. The Exploratory Analysis helps us understand the data better by spotting patterns, trends, and linkages in the data, while Multiple Linear Regression and Time Series enables us to model and predict future population changes based on historical data. The findings of this comprehensive analysis will lead to a more sophisticated understanding of worldwide birth rates and their implications for future population expansion. The findings will help policymakers, researchers, and organizations involved in population planning and policy formation make educated decisions and develop solutions to address population-related concerns.
